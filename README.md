AWS Lambda which returns F-droid repo XML from GitHub releases.

## Intro

Great way to distribute your Android apps, either personally for testing or production releases is to use GitHub releases and
use this function to present your releases via GitHub API as an F-droid repo format.

You can also use [GitHub Actions](https://medium.com/@wkrzywiec/github-actions-for-android-first-approach-f616c24aa0f9) to automatically build and upload APKs.
